I'm Vincent, a final-year student at ISAE-ENSMA, a prestigious aeronautical engineering school 🎓. I'm set to graduate in 2024 with a specialization in Embedded Systems and a Master's in Big Data 📊.

### Robotics Enthusiast 🤖

I had the privilege of serving as the President of the Robotics Club @ensmasteel from 2021 to 2024 🎉. During my tenure, our team participated in 3 National Robotics Cups, where I was responsible for designing the circuit boards 📈. Those were incredible experiences that shaped my skills and passion for robotics.

### Current Project 🚧

I'm currently working on building a robot for the 2025 edition of the French Robotics Cup 🇫🇷. I'm utilizing ROS2 and Gazebo to bring this project to life 🤩. Stay tuned for updates on my progress!

### About Me 👋

As an aeronautical engineering student with a strong interest in embedded systems and big data, I'm always looking to explore new technologies and collaborate on innovative projects. Feel free to browse my repositories, and let's connect if you share similar interests 🤝.
