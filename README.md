I'm Vincent, a final-year student at ISAE-ENSMA, a prestigious aeronautical engineering school 🎓. I'm set to graduate in 2024 with a **specialization in Embedded Systems** and a **Master's in Big Data** 📊.

### Robotics Enthusiast 🤖

I had the privilege of serving as the President of the Robotics Club @ensmasteel from 2021 to 2024 🎉. During my tenure, our team participated in 3 National Robotics Cups, where I was responsible for designing the circuit boards 📈. Those were incredible experiences that shaped my skills and passion for robotics.

### Current Project 🚧

I'm currently working on multi agent robotics exploration and mapping as a research scholar at Ilinois Tech in CHicago.
As for personal projects, I'm currently working on building a robot for the 2025 edition of the French Robotics Cup 🇫🇷. I'm utilizing ROS2 and Gazebo to bring this project to life 🤩. Stay tuned for updates on my progress!
